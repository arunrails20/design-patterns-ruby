Browse through the [Documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/emilsoman/design-patterns-ruby/master/frames).

Here's the plan:

1. Add all design patterns as Ruby examples
2. Each example should have 100% green test coverage
3. Each example should have RDocs/YARDocs that explain what each class does.
4. If there is a Ruby way that bakes in the pattern in the language, do not re-invent the wheel and show the Ruby way.
Explain how the example works.
