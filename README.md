====================

## Design patterns in Ruby

Here's the plan:

1. Add all design patterns as Ruby examples
2. Each example should have 100% green test coverage
3. Each example should have inline docs and a README.md
4. If there is a Ruby way that bakes in the pattern in the language, do not re-invent the wheel and show the Ruby way.
Explain how the example works.
