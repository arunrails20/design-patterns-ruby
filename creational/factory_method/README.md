Factory Method
==============
Factory Method defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate.

## Scenarios
Use Factory Method when a client shouldn't be tightly bound to the type of an object it uses. 
The client who needs to use the object gets it from the Factory method instead of specifying
the type within itself.
